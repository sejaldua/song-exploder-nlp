In this episode, Dave tells the story of making heat waves over several months, first on his own and then later with his bandmates Joe seaward at Irwin singer and drew McFarlane here's glass animals on Song exploder. They nice in the middle. He was thinking he can make you I'm Dave from glass animals. May 2018 is when I first started something and I didn't feel like there's any pressure to make another glass animals record we weren't in a rush. So I was going into the studio every day long hours. Just getting crazy since sat just finding sounds that have this like exploratory phase before actually making an album for the band, which is just me eating lots of cereal and doing nerdy things, twisting knobs. I was in the studio complex, North London called the church. There are some bigger artists and all the other rooms and I was in this little basement room and I was ready to go home and had a long very unsuccessful day in the studio. I always use this fishing analogy of Arlo Guthrie is where he always said that writing songs is like fishing, you change your bait that's a fresh bait and you can move your boat to a new spot you can get some new line you can try all these tricks but you know mainly just catch like tires and weeds and like weird fish that you can't eat. And I'd had a whole day of that just catching weird fish. But I was like fine, one more. I always have a guitar plugged in. And a microphone. I think I just hit record picked up the guitar. And that's when I started like fumbling around. I've been reading some gimmicky book about songwriting. And it was about like how you can kind of get these longer chord phrases that tell a story. And I was like, oh, let's try something like that. So I was trying to get this longer chord phrase and started noodling around trying to find eight chords that fit together and had some kind of arc took you on a bit of a journey. It was about nine minutes of fumbling. And then I played that chord pattern as Oh, that's cool. So I play it over and over again. They had this very reflective quality, but then it resolves quite well, that chord pattern and it feels like maybe like coming to terms with something okay, acceptance. And I think that's probably where the lyric came from. I think one of the first things that came out of my mouth was that vocal line is late at night and I was thinking about all those people that I missed. Don't stop to think You know that I never gone on. You know, I do all sorts of things to my vocal when I'm recording these write ideas because I, I think like many people, I really hate the sound of my own voice. So sometimes I pitch it down in octaves, sometimes I pitch it up in Octave. And I don't know, I just have all these tricks to kind of disassociate yourself from from you. And this was kind of around the time that I started using auto tune. To do that. For me. I feel like a lot of music is about not overthinking things. And when it's your own voice, it's so easy to overthink it. It's I don't know, I think sometimes I'm on zoom, and I can see people looking at their own picture. And kind of losing sense of the conversation. And I don't know, it's kind of the same thing, it stops you doing that it stops you just allows you to not think about the rules and how it should sound and try not to make everything too perfect. Visual. At that point, I kind of tried to firm up a sound. When I have the guitar live recording, it's not often a particularly interesting sound. So I just recorded the guitar, pitched it down an octave, pitched it up an octave. And that just left enough space for the vocal to sit in between. Because a lot of writing a song is about leaving a space for the vocal to breathe. You just need a better life. You need to come in I can never think what it's gone. Now the dad is calm. But the guitar was a bit plucky in tinkly. So I need some water was a really deep, rich sounding synthesizer. And I remember putting the drums on after those cents. Well, at that point, I just looped everything I had. And loads of different verse ideas came out loads of different hooks came out. And also because the chords are moving so much, you could use quite rhythmic vocal patterns that weren't necessarily crazy melodies to keep things moving here, the chords did a lot of moving for you. So I put the auto tune in key picked up the microphone and and then I just went for it. And I think after about two minutes, I was like, well, I've got loads to go with here. I tend to feel very comfortable writing late at night, I think there's a part of your brain that really the sensible bit that keeps you alive starts to shut down. You just get to that point in the night. And that part of the sensible bits gone. And like these weird bits, your brain start coming out. At that point, I think it's probably time to head home. I'm knackered the song ended, had someone behind me and I said, Whoa, whoa, I thought I was alone in here. I turned around and there's just someone sitting there at the piano with a glass of wine. So why is this? Who's that? Who are you? And I just said it's john. And I say who is john? I don't know, john, they were wearing really nice suit. And this is so strange for So hi, john. And they turned around. And it was Johnny Depp. I couldn't believe I was like so weirdly, Johnny Depp was the first person to hear this song. Someone who was working in one of the studios above me came in and was like, oh, Dave, I'm sorry. JOHN got lost. And he'd gotten like he was working with someone in a different studio. And anyway, that was pretty weird. And then they invited me upstairs to go hang out. So that was that was the end of day one. I just didn't touch it for like six months. And then I was going on another la trip and was going to be pitching songs for a particular pop artist. One of my favorite pop artists as well as so excited nervous and I was digging through just old stuff and I think I remembered this and showed it to this pop artist. So no success. I mean, it would have been a great thing to have one of my favorite pop artists sing a song but at the same time it was a really personal piece of music and I think part of me would have actually been a bit sad if I'd given it away. Sometimes I think about is you late nights in the middle of June. By the way, it's been thickened, he can make you happy home now, sometimes I think about as you late nights in the middle of June, it means something very specific to me. But I like it when a chorus lyric can be interpreted in lots of different ways. For me, it's actually very, very personal. I lost someone, I lost my best friend, some time ago now. I'm getting a bit while the IPA but this particular person had their birthday in June. And every time their birthday comes up it just like it ruins me. I guess this whole song is about missing somebody. And people are just kind of vulnerable to that you can't do anything about it. You can't help and save everybody. And it's okay to let yourself miss someone and feel this feel this pain. So, after it had been denied by this particular pop artist, I think I was like, Oh, this is good. I have ammunition to show to the band. And I think we're going to the studio in November, December. And I was like, cool. This is another one I can show the guys. And maybe, maybe they're like it. There's add, Joe and drew. These guys are amazing players and musicians, in a way that I am not in show is always very keen on acoustic drums. I think they just add life, that feel of a good drummer is really hard to replicate with electronic drums. So Joe always has a pass with acoustic drums. July of that year, Joe had a really terrible accident, he was injured very badly and couldn't walk a talk for a long time. But Joe is very stubborn. And he was riding a bike when he had his accident, the first thing you wanted to do was get on his bike again. And the second thing you want to do is get back on the drum kit. And it just wouldn't let anything stand in his way. And he is playing with the groove that he always had. Sometimes it takes a lot of time getting drums to sit together. But I love layering like snare sounds and kick sounds. And it can be quite a fine process. Sometimes I'll cut all the low end out of one cut or the high end of another to get them to blend together and then run that through tape machine. It's a long and very tedious process that everybody hates watching me do. And I'm sorry, to everyone who's ever seen it. And then drew and I were doing a lot of orchestral arrangements for everything. And he he was keen to put these big stabs in. Big orchestral kind of Moody, born. And then of a slightly cheesy jazzy guitar on the off beats. In those jazzy kind of seventh chords, it adds a little bit of optimism. Because ultimately, I think the song is meant to be optimistic is really sad at its core, but it's kind of about accepting that sadness and vulnerabilities. Okay. Road sim shimmer wiggling the vision, heat waves, I'm swimming in a mirror. The lyrics are all about mirages. And reflection usually puts them on TV. So we never think about you and me. But today I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood laying on the screen. I just had this picture of two people sitting on a sofa and looking into the TV screen and seeing the reflection of the two of you and realizing that you can't help them and it kind of breaks your heart. Yeah. I think the song was really intimate and really personal. So I liked the idea of the verse being really simple, just one single vocal and then the chorus is I wanted to beef it up big time. Sometimes I think about is you know it's in the middle. can be he can make you happy. Sometimes I think about as you lay nice. He was man faking the can make you happy. I absolutely love 808 bass. I used to DJ till quite late at night and then not be able to sleep. I'd come home and Stop making music while on my housemates were asleep. And I just I needed to feel that bass outside the club. So yeah, I've always been obsessed with 808. So that intro is the first demo. The first everything that was ever recorded for this is that I thought that was a nice way to round it off because I kind of like to think that albums, they're kind of like a snapshot of who you are in that certain period of time and where your head's at. Sometimes it's just useful to like help you get to the next step. If you think about like the idea of the song and the concept, it can just be it can be a helpful trick. But really, I think in this case, it felt like a nice nod back to something really, really personal and starting just alone at night. In a room until Johnny Depp showed up. And now here's heat waves by glass animals in its entirety. He always been second he can make you happy. He was been second he can make you happy. Usually the monkey so we never see our refractions clearly in Hollywood lamp on the screen. You just need a better knife. You need some good I can we can make you can fight. You can breathe you know I gotta let you go. You'll be better off. You look so broken when you cry. I say goodbye I can make you can make you happy. When you sleep and smile so comfortable. I just wish that I could give you the bad luck as perfectly as you can. They can make you happy times. ways they can make you happy.
