It hit number one on the charts in 13 countries and it was shortlisted for the UK Mercury Prize. One of the songs on the record is levitating. Do a co wrote it with some of our closest collaborators, including producer Steven cosmic, aka cause In this episode, do and cause breakdown, levitating and explain how do his childhood memories shaped the song sound? My name is do alipur The day I wrote this song, I actually know the exact date levitating was created on the 28th of August 2018. I guess I just started writing for the second record, is still figuring out where I wanted to go with it. But knowing what my album title was going to be, which is future nostalgia. And I knew I wanted to touch on my childhood influences. And a lot of my childhood influences are really songs and music that my parents listened to a lot of Jamiroquai prints Blondie, and when those songs are played, now that just brings back such a rush of fun and exciting like emotions. And all I want to do is dance and immediately takes me back to when I was a kid and I wanted to play on that emotion and that feeling and those memories and create something with like a fresh modern twist. I'm cause I'm the producer of levitating causes such an incredible instrumentalist and producer and artist in his own right, and we've worked together for a really long time. Usually before we go into work, like I'll spend a couple weeks or a month just like coming up with ideas to play when we hit the studio. before the session I'd kind of like sent him like some notes on some stuff that I've been inspired by, she definitely had the idea of blending a lot of old stuff with new stuff. I just thought like the best way to reinterpret the past was just use old instruments. I had been looking for this since forever called the role in Vp 330. I probably been looking for 678 years. And then one day I found it in Tokyo. Got it back to Toronto, I just plugged it in. And literally the first thing I played was like what turned into levitating the whole song was basically just built around that one patch, you know, this great synthetic choir sound it was the first thing I play on it and I just happened to be recording because sometimes I feel it's just the best time to catch something. And then just kind of looped it started building a song around it. And then it has like a sound that's like analog strings and that's also that synth. You know, it's like you don't want a keyboard that does like 100 things you want one that does just a couple things really well. It just has like a vibe and a sound. I was kind of thinking it'd be cool to do it. It's kind of like a slinky disco track. He was pretty simple. A lot of these times you don't build them out too much, you just build out like just a great vibe to kind of write to and then forget about them until you hit the studio and then hit play. I wrote levitating are some of my close friends and collaborators Sara Hudson, coffee, Clarence, Jr. and cause and I've worked with all three of them for so long and coffee is brilliant with melodies. And Sarah is very much like a fairy godmother. And she starts every session with a tarot reading, it would be like another way of opening up and talking about, like, our experiences of what was going on in life. And it instantly changes the energy in the room. So it was a good laugh with all of us. But sessions are an interesting thing, because it's actually quite nerve wracking. And so we went to the studio, he was like, Okay, he's like, I have some tracks. He's like, I'd love to, like, play some stuff that I've been working on with like you in mind and what you kind of told me, I think maybe levitating was one of the first tracks he played, someone would have their phone out. And just as you were playing the beats and stuff, like you get your immediate reaction to melody and you just kind of capture it. Just so you don't forget it when you go back to it. This one stemmed pretty heavily from Dua in the room. It can happen so many different ways. People just start singing something, but I remember like, do it really loud. This one, almost immediately, we went into the melody of and then you kind of hear Sarah in the background going, oh my god. It came so naturally and we were just ready to go and we just felt like such an easy like, yes, that's what we're going into. She was like instant on the melody. You know, you make it up along the way. But it's just all about like the feeling. We had the visual of being in like an Austin Powers movie. And having Mike Myers just somehow like doing some random levitating dance that we were just making up that was just like helping give us like a mood while we were writing the lyrics. We ordered these donuts because I was like, how are we going to spice this and sample some donuts we all had total like sugar rush, and just started writing and I think that we will literally levitating from the sugar rush. We had such like a good feeling like going into that song. If you want to run away with me, I know what galaxy and that could take you for a ride. I had a premonition that we fall into a rhythm with the music don't stop for life. I recorded my vocals on the same day. I do the lead vocals and then some backing vocals. Your me, aren't you baby, not sugarboo I'm levitated we have the lyric sugarboo which is quite funny, because it's something that we call each other and thought it would be kind of a cute thing to put in. But it's more something that we're like we say as a funny joke. And I was like, Are we sure we want to put this in the song and it just seemed like such a funny, cute thing. And an ode to like our friendship. Now sugarboo unlimited. I love collaborating and creating, like such fun personal relationships with the people that I'm writing with. Because we can be so silly and be so open with each other and because we have that friendship and that's really important. I think a big part of like, songwriting is like daring to be a bit shit like have an idea that's, you know, you don't know whether it's good or not, but you have to almost like say it. During the second record, I knew that I wanted to make it with my friends and people that I'd work with for so long and people that are so comfortable around that I felt like I didn't have anything to prove. And coffee he would help him like elevate the melodies and every time it would be better when coffees gets his hands on it better in the sky. I I feel like every time we get together, but whatever, let's go last on Mars. I feel like we found ourselves dancing all the way through making this record like non stop even when we weren't completely finished or even if we were having a writer's block or even if we were like still figuring it out and working on the production like there wasn't a moment where we weren't just kind of feeling the music and having fun. I got to hear come on down to me. The way the hook is actually thrown away, like That I think is so cool in the songs this you know, I'm levitating. It's just like very like, it's not where you kind of like see the traditional hook. It didn't feel like it was trying too hard, it felt a bit more like laid back. And then I take it into like a more talky thing because I wanted to get my British accent out a bit more because a lot of the time when I sing I guess people can't tell that I'm British. And I'm like, Okay, this is I have to take the melody out of it. And I have to like talk sing it. My love is like a rocket what's your blast? phenom Phyllis, so electric dancer, our sauce, and even if I wanted to account and then we do some gang vocals. Yeah. Those are always really funny to make them like we wanted to make it like sound really yappy and really childish. And the part that everyone can like join in on and stuff. We were all like quiet in a tie area. So we would put the mic on one side of the room. So we would get like different sounds coming from different parts of the room and somebody would be closer and somebody would be farther away. Not only do we just like go in and do it with our own voices, but then we go in and put on voices and we do like we create like personas, every kind of vocal take that we do like for the bV is it's always really fun. It's all about like, the ambience and creating like a whole world around the song that's beyond just the lyrics and the vocal. It's about like the whole story behind it. Ah, we did the whole song in a day, we just stormed through, got all the sections, cut everything in the room. Then like towards the end of it. We asked to work with Stewart price. We produce Confessions on the dance floor from Madonna and other great records killers, Pet Shop Boys. And he just basically helped with the fundamental bass groove like he kind of went in and brought more bounce to the song. And then there's like a high drone sent at one point. I mean, it's such like a disco trunk, but it was like it was perfect. And then it just kind of held through in this one section. He also like added a string part in the pre chorus, which was really cool. Alongside that, cause was a fan of this like talkbox player called Bosco Conte, he like reached out for him to come in and play on the song as well. I love talkbox I think it's like the coolest thing in the world. There's like little bits layered here and there that just gives it like a cool like old school 80s zap funk undertones into it. It's a song that just makes me feel so good. It makes me want to dance. But then once it's out and into the world, almost that song doesn't belong to me anymore. But it belongs to everyone that's come to see the show and the memories that it holds for them. And it excites me so much to get out and perform a song that is just kind of taken a life of its own and has created memories. Have you ever thought about the idea of a kid being in the position that you were in with your parents, like some kid up there who's listening to their parents, listen to your music You know, I haven't really thought of it that way. That would be so cool. It's really exciting to think that maybe someone could be influenced like that by my music but it's also such a such a crazy thought. And now here's levitating by dua Lipa in its entirety.
